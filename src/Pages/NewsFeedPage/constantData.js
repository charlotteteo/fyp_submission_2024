An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 has reached a historic high, suggesting a broadening rally. Furthermore, valuations of the largest stocks are below those seen at the peak of previous market cycles. The seven largest tech firms contribute about 20% to S&P 500 earnings, which justifies their market-capitalization weighting of about a third of the gauge.","sentiment":0.0,"link":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bubble-angst-belied-big-tech-120000734.html"},{"title":"End of AI boom?
